 uscivilwar.1.t:0 "Turmoil in the United States"
 uscivilwar.1.d:0 "Chaos in the Union! The United States is on the brink of collapse! The 1936 elections are scheduled for later, in November, but should we push them ahead? Or wait it out and see if the situation resolves itself? Either may have consequences for America."
 uscivilwar.1.a:0 "Elections can wait, we need to stabilize first."
 uscivilwar.1.b:0 "There is no time! Schedule them for February!"
 uscivilwar.2.t:0 "United States Federal Elections"
 uscivilwar.2.d:0 "More cracks have appeared across the United States as of late. People are becoming more and more seperated every day, aligning towards a different faction or political movement, with the most powerful being the Christian Socialist Union, and the All-American Front. Anarchist graffiti and symbolism has appeared in the western states and cities, mainly Seattle, and across the south, Texan and Mexican independence movements have started to gain traction. Hopefully this election fixes everything. The main candidates are another term for Roosevelt, who has lost public support as of recent, and the Republican, Alf Landon, who has promised a new spin on Roosevelt's Deal, and has assured all seperatists will be dealt with."
 uscivilwar.2.a:0 "Elect the Democrats! One more term, no matter the consequences!"
 uscivilwar.2.b:0 "Elect the Republicans! We need a new face, with new ideas!"
 uscivilwar.3.t:0 "Democrats Win 1936 Election"
 uscivilwar.3.d:0 "In a surprise turn of events, the Democratic Party has won the 1936 elections! While F.D.R. was losing popular support for a while, it seems that it didn't impede him enough to lose the elections. He has promised to lead the United States into a new era of prosperity, starting with bringing about a "New Deal," one that he hopes will lead the States out of Depression and into the new age."
 uscivilwar.3.a:0 "We won somehow, lets make the most of it!"
 uscivilwar.4.t:0 "Republicans Win 1936 Election"
 uscivilwar.4.d:0 "Surprising to nobody, the Republican Party has won the 1936 US elections! Alf Landon has promised to undo the mistakes of his forbearers, and reunite the fracturing United States. He has sworn to crush Bolshevism and nationalism. His vigour in these tasks seems absolute. We will have to see where this takes us, whether to unity or war."
 uscivilwar.4.a:0 "We have won the elections! Time to fix America!"
 uscivilwar.5.t:0 "Socialist Revolts in Chicago and New York"
 uscivilwar.5.d:0 "Socialists of all forms have united in open revolt across the cities of Chicago and New York, declaring the latest elections false, and that President [Root.GetLeader] does not have the worker's interests in mind. These revolts were quickly put down by National Guard forces across the rebellious districts and counties. While easy to destroy, these small revolutions may lead to something larger..."
 uscivilwar.5.a:0 "Crush these rebels fast, we can't have a worker's revolution during the Depression!"
 uscivilwar.6.t:0 "Socialist Front Declares Independence"
 uscivilwar.6.d:0 "Terrible news! The Socialist Front, based in Chicago and New York, has declared independence from the rest of the Union! We have reports of militia-men being mobilised in the occupied territories, and have mobilised the National Guard in response. As we speak we are receiving news of military and nationalist revolts throughout the southern States as well. What has happened to our United States?"
 uscivilwar.6.a:0 "God save us all..."
 uscivilwar.6.b:0 "Long live the Revolution! [Play as the Socialists]"
 uscivilwar.7.t:0 "Nationalist Front Declares Independence"
 uscivilwar.7.d:0 "Across the American "Deep South," nationalist militias rise up across the rebellious states, armed and ready to fight. Several US Army divisions have splintered off and are currently mobilising to their new positions, the Nationalist-Loyalist border. All through-out the south, the stars and stripes are taken down, and replaced with regimental standards, Confederate battle flags, state flags, and even a few county flags. Father Coughlin, a member of the Plutocratic Front within the All-American Nationalist Front, has made a speech in New Orleans, saying the "traitors to American democracy will be dead soon, Washington will fall, and with it, the enemies of the real patriots of America."
 uscivilwar.7.a:0 "I bet my boots we'll kick 'em out, right away!"
 uscivilwar.7.b:0 "For a new America! [Play as the Nationalists]"
 uscivilwar.8.t:0 "Texan and Mexican Revolt"
 uscivilwar.8.d:0 "Texas has declared independence! Their National Guard and a few scattered militias have occupied Dallas and Houston, and it seems a few counties in Oklahoma and New Mexico have joined their "Lone Star Republic." Even worse is the reports of Mexican-funded militias and guerillas overtaking border posts, garrisons, and military installations. It seems the Mexican Nationalist government is funding revolts in our southern lands. We must react to hese terrorists and traitors!"
 uscivilwar.8.a:0 "Crush these scum! For America!"
 uscivilwar.8.b:0 "The Lone Star stands again! [Play as Texas]"
 uscivilwar.9.t:0 "Anarchist Front Emerges"
 uscivilwar.9.d:0 "Across the northwest, anarchist militias and revolutionary gangs emerge under a "united" banner. They claim America is a dead nation, and that the age of defined borders and countries has passed. They are weakest of our foes, but another distraction nonetheless. We should attack now!"
 uscivilwar.9.a:0 "Crush these so-called Revolutionaries!"
 uscivilwar_problem.1.t:0 "Anarchist Activity in Seattle"
 uscivilwar_problem.1.d:0 "Contrary to what the media is saying in Washington State, Anarchist activity has increased tenfold in the past months, and is on the rise across the more destitute districts of the city. Graffiti depicting F.D.R. hanging with various texts along the lines of "Liberate America" has become commonplace throughout alleyways. If this goes anywhere, we may see an Anarchist revolt in the northwest."
 uscivilwar_problem.1.a:0 "Dispatch extra police to Seattle and monitor poorer regions for rebels."
 uscivilwar_problem.2.t:0 "Mexican and Texan Insurgents"
 uscivilwar_problem.2.d:0 "Reports are coming in from Texas and New Mexico that insurgent forces, seemingly funded by the United Mexican States, are patrolling the countryside, looting and fighting back local police forces, who are valiantly trying to hold them off. National Guard and Army have been mobilised to deal with this threat. Hopefully these rebels aren't a sign of things to come for our nation."
 uscivilwar_problem.2.a:0 "Send in everything available, we can't have this snowball into anything larger."
 uscivilwar_problem.3.t:0 "Army in Revolt"
 uscivilwar_problem.3.d:0 "In Florida and Louisiana, several Army divisions and regiments have revolted, citing the want for better wages and benefits, which the government cannot provide. During these revolts, the All-American National Front has made several strikes against the State government, seizing arms and vehicles. More upsetting is the fact that some of our striking regiments joined in on these raids. General Patton has openly ackowledged these raids, and has not condemned them, saying America needs strong leadership right now, and F.D.R. is the opposite of what the country needs."
 uscivilwar_problem.3.a:0 "Court martial all traitors! Send in loyal forces to eliminate all dissidents!"
 uscivilwar_news.1.t:0 "United States on Verge of Collapse"
 uscivilwar_news.1.d:0 "The United States is in turmoil! Long has the nation stood united, but rampant plague, the depression, and the growth of radicalism has resulted in the creation of Socialist militias and deserter regiments. Socialist and Nationalist groups strike key targets across their controlled zones, as loyal regiments attempt to quell the rebellion. Radio reports indicate the Army is outmatched, mainly due to be being overstretched. And in Texas, the governor has called for seceding from the Union, in order to "save Texan spirit." It is a dark time for the United States. And it seems war is inevitable."
 uscivilwar_news.1.a:0 "We shall crush these scum and re-unite our fractured nation!"
 uscivilwar_news.1.b:0 "Troubling..."
 uscivilwar_news.2.t:0 "The 2nd US Civil War"
 uscivilwar_news.2.d:0 "To some it was inevitable, to most it seemed impossible. But now the unthinkable has happened. A second Civil War has broken out across the United States. The war is fought between the Socialists, Nationalists, Loyalists, and a few smaller contenders. This war may spell doom for the once great nation. But only time may tell if democracy and liberty will prevail, or if the Home of the Free will become the Home of the Damned and Depraved."
 uscivilwar_news.2.a:0 "For Democracy! America will stand against radicalism!"
 uscivilwar_news.2.b:0 "My God..."
 uscivilwarcan.1.t:0 "The Border Lays Open"
 uscivilwarcan.1.d:0 "Long has Canada been in the United State's shadow. We have been said to be weaker, less industrious, less populus, less powerful. Now the US is killing itself in a brutal civil war. The borders lay unguarded, and now we can finally take what should be ours..."
 uscivilwarcan.1.a:0 "Take the borderlands, no need to start a war."
 uscivilwarcan.1.b:0 "Take Alaska! Take New England! Canada shall stand tall!"
 uscivilwarcan.1.c:0 "The United States has always been our ally, we cannot take their lands."
 uscivilwarcan.2.t:0 "Retake Baja?"
 uscivilwarcan.2.d:0 "The northern portion of Baja California was annexed at Versailles, after our disastrous invasion of the United States. Now that the USA is embroiled in Civil War, we can retake what is ours!"
 uscivilwarcan.2.a:0 "Retake our lands!"
 uscivilwarcan.2.b:0 "We cannot risk war again."
